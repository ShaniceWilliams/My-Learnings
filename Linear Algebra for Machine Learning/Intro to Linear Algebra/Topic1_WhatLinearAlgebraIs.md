# Topic 1 - What Linear Algebra is

An example of algebra could be something as simple as this:

Examples such as these cannot be considered linear:

### Linear Algebra is: Solving for unknowns within a system of linear equations

A simple example of a linear problem could be:
- A cop has a 180km/h car
- A thief has a 150km/h car
- Considering that they are travelling in a straight line (not taking traffic or acceleration etc into consideration):
  - How long will it take for the cop to catch the thief?
  - What distance will they have travelled at that point?

This kind of problem can be solved by plotting the paths the two cars take:



It can also be solved algebraically:
